## Neovim Setup
I'm gradually switching from Vim to Neovim
Because neovim is cooler and I don't really need so many fancy functionalities 

### Hot Keys

Key | Function 
--- | --------
jk  | esc
ctrl+p | open markdown preview
ctrl+n | open nerdtree (move cursor to nerdtree)
ctrl+m | move cursor to editor
ctrl+\ | open/close ternimal
